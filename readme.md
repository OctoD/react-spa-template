Another React SPA Template
==========================

# Why

Because I prefer spending my time not tweaking configuration files etc

# How

It uses vitejs for building stuff, storybook for visual testing and chakra-ui as
a solid UI foundation.

# Features

- vitejs build
- redux
- react-intl with language extractor script
- storybook 
- chakra-ui

# Install

Use this repo as a template, clone it and then

```bash
yarn
# or if you prefer
npm i
```

# Scripts

- `dev` runs the dev server
- `storybook` runs the storybook
- `build` builds the SPA
- `serve` serves the SPA
- `translate` extracts `react-intl` keys and save translation jsons in `src/lang` directory
